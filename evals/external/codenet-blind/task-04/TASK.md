Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer
L
in base two.
How many pairs of non-negative integers
(a, b)
satisfy the following conditions?
a + b \leq L
a + b = a \mbox{ XOR } b
Since there can be extremely many such pairs, print the count modulo
10^9 + 7
.
What is XOR?
The XOR of integers
A
and
B
,
A \mbox{ XOR } B
, is defined as follows:
When
A \mbox{ XOR } B
is written in base two, the digit in the
2^k
's place (
k \geq 0
) is
1
if either
A
or
B
, but not both, has
1
in the
2^k
's place, and
0
otherwise.
For example,
3 \mbox{ XOR } 5 = 6
. (In base two:
011 \mbox{ XOR } 101 = 110
.)
