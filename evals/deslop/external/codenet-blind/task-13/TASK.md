Problem Statement
A
bracket sequence
is a string that is one of the following:
An empty string;
The concatenation of
(
,
A
, and
)
in this order, for some bracket sequence
A
;
The concatenation of
A
and
B
in this order, for some non-empty bracket sequences
A
and
B
/
Given are
N
strings
S_i
. Can a bracket sequence be formed by concatenating all the
N
strings in some order?
Constraints
1 \leq N \leq 10^6

S_i
is at most
10^6
.
S_i
is a non-empty string consisting of
(
and
)
.
